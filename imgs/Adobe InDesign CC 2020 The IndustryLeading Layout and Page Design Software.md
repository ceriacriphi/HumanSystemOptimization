## What's New in Adobe InDesign CC 2020?
 
Adobe InDesign CC 2020 is constantly adding new features and updates to improve your workflow and enhance your creativity. Here are some of the highlights of what's new in InDesign CC 2020:
 
- **Variable fonts:** You can now adjust the weight, width, slant, and optical size of variable fonts directly in InDesign. Variable fonts are fonts that have multiple variations within a single font file. This gives you more flexibility and control over your typography.
- **SVG import:** You can now import SVG files into your InDesign documents. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a format that allows you to create and edit vector graphics that scale without losing quality. You can also apply effects, transparency, and color to SVG files.
- **Content-Aware Fit:** You can now automatically fit an image to its frame using Content-Aware Fit. This feature uses Adobe Sensei technology to intelligently detect the most important part of the image and crop it accordingly. You can also adjust the fit manually if needed.
- **Column rules:** You can now add rules (lines) between columns of text in a multi-column text frame. This can help you create a clear separation between columns and improve readability.
- **Find similar images:** You can now find similar images on Adobe Stock directly from InDesign. Simply right-click on an image in your document and choose Find Similar Images. This will open a browser window with relevant images from Adobe Stock that you can license and use.
