One of the most popular books for preparing for the DELE A2 exam is El Cronometro, a series of manuals that provide practice tests, tips, strategies, and feedback for each section of the exam. El Cronometro has different editions for different levels of the DELE exam, from A1 to C2.
 
In this article, we will focus on the El Cronometro edition for the DELE A2 exam, which was updated in 2013 to reflect the changes in the exam format. The book contains four complete practice tests with answer keys and explanations, as well as a CD with audio recordings for the listening section. The book also includes a self-evaluation guide, a grammar review, and a vocabulary list.
 
The main advantage of El Cronometro is that it simulates the real conditions of the DELE A2 exam, with timed exercises and realistic tasks. The book also helps you identify your strengths and weaknesses, and gives you useful advice on how to improve your performance. The book is designed to be used independently or with a teacher or tutor.
 
However, El Cronometro also has some limitations. The book does not cover all the topics and situations that may appear in the DELE A2 exam, so you will need to complement it with other materials and sources of input. The book also does not provide enough practice for the oral section of the exam, which requires interaction with an examiner and another candidate. Therefore, you will need to find opportunities to practice your speaking skills with native speakers or other learners.
 
Another issue with El Cronometro is that it is not easy to find online or in bookstores. The book is published by Edinumen, a Spanish publisher that specializes in teaching Spanish as a foreign language. The book can be ordered from their website[^1^], but it may take some time and cost some shipping fees to receive it. Alternatively, you can try to find a PDF version of the book online[^2^] [^3^] [^4^], but be aware that this may violate the copyright laws and harm the authors.
 
In conclusion, El Cronometro is a valuable resource for preparing for the DELE A2 exam, but it should not be the only one. You should also use other books, websites, podcasts, videos, and apps to expose yourself to different types of input and practice your skills. You should also seek feedback from qualified teachers or tutors who can help you correct your mistakes and improve your strategies. Finally, you should practice under realistic conditions and familiarize yourself with the exam format and criteria.
  
If you are wondering how to register for the DELE A2 exam, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Check the exam dates and locations on the official website of the Instituto Cervantes. The DELE A2 exam is offered several times a year in different countries and cities.
2. Choose the date and location that suit you best and fill out the online registration form. You will need to provide some personal information and pay the exam fee, which varies depending on the country and level.
3. Once you have completed the registration process, you will receive a confirmation email with your exam details and instructions. You will also receive a notification email a few days before the exam with your exam center and schedule.

On the day of the exam, you will need to bring your ID or passport, a printed copy of your confirmation email, and a pen or pencil. You will also need to arrive at least 15 minutes before the start of the exam and follow the instructions of the examiners and staff. The DELE A2 exam consists of four sections: reading comprehension, listening comprehension, written expression and interaction, and oral expression and interaction. The total duration of the exam is about 80 minutes.
  
After taking the exam, you will have to wait for about two months to receive your results.

You will also receive a certificate by mail if you have passed the exam. The certificate is valid for life and internationally recognized.
  
If you have not passed the exam, you can retake it as many times as you want. However, you will have to pay the exam fee again and register for a new date and location. You can also request a review of your exam if you think there has been an error in the correction or evaluation of your test. You will have to fill out a form and pay a fee within 10 days after receiving your results.
